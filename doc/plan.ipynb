    "# Project Plan:\n",
    "## Assumptions:\n",
    "- I am going to assume that the recommender engine will not include user/customer information. You would need user demographics, user behavior, and probably device data and other data to make a recommender, but we don't have that. I assume that will be what is being simulated by the data scientists. Because I don't know what variables they will want to change, I don't know what fields they will need in the tables, so for now I am just going to assume they will be creating user demographic data.\n",
    "- I am going to assume that the data scientists know how to use pandas.\n",
    "- I am going to assume that analysts can use pgadmin to access the database for ad hoc queries\n",
    "- I am going to assume that the data scientists will use ipython notebooks to interact with the db.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Objectives:\n",
    "- Provide a database to support the simulation engine.\n",
    "- Offer both direct SQL access and Python APIs for read and write operations.\n",
    "- Create a demonstration recommender engine.\n",

    "### 1. Evaluate and Select RDBMS:\n",
    "#### Objective: Choose an RDBMS that fits the needs of the project.\n",
    "#### Tasks:\n",
    "##### PostgreSQL is an optimal choice for the recommender system for these reasons:\n",
    "- Scalability: It offers high scalability, accommodating both vertical and horizontal growth, making it suitable for an expanding system.\n",
    "- Performance: PostgreSQL is known for handling complex queries efficiently. This is particularly beneficial for a recommender system that requires complex data interactions.\n",
    "- Community Support: With a strong open-source community, PostgreSQL provides extensive documentation, forums, and support, aiding in both development and troubleshooting.\n",
    "- Ease of Integration with Python ORMs: PostgreSQL can be easily interfaced with Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools like FastAPI and SQLModel, allowing for a more streamlined and efficient development process.\n",
    "- In summary, the combination of scalability, advanced query performance, vibrant community support, and easy integration with popular Python ORMs makes PostgreSQL a fitting choice for building a recommender system that can evolve and adapt to complex data needs.\n",
